### Hi there

I love to code. I started with PHP a long time ago, learned SQL on a student job, picked up Java on my first real job, learned Go during an assignment and then worked with Kotlin and Java for several years.

I also really like cloud native development. Initially I started with Google Cloud, and I still love some of their features like Cloud Run and BigQuery, but my focus has shifted mostly to AWS as I got to use it in the last few years and even got some certificates on it.

Most recently I work at [Generac Clean Energy](https://www.generac.com/for-homeowners/clean-energy/clean-energy) which has been a great place to master mobile React Native development and contribute towards the energy transition towards a more sustainable future!
