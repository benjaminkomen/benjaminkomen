### Hi there

I love to code. I started with PHP a long time ago, learned SQL on a student job, picked up Java on my first real job, learned Go during an assignment and I'm currently doing most work in Kotlin. I also really like cloud native development. I found out the Google Cloud is great for that, although AWS also has some nice features.

Most recently I worked at [Xebia Software Development](https://software.xebia.com/) which I absolutely loved! If you would like to get in touch, you can do so via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BenjaminKomen).
